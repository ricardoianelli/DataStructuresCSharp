## 💻 About the project

Here we'll create homemade implementations of some data structures using C#. 
Feel free to contribute!

## 💫 Roadmap

- [ ] List
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Stack

## ⚙️ Structure

The project will be divided in folders so that we can reuse in a simple way the data structures created at first.
We'll use good practices like Clean Code, SOLID, and will try our best to do TDD.

## 🚀 How to run the project

At first I haven't tougth of any user interaction with the program. Later on I'll be adding something.
If you want to run the project tests to have proof it works, just go to the project folder on the terminal and run the following command:
```
dotnet test
```

It should run the project unit tests and present the results.
